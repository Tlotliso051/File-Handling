File handling is a fundamental aspect of programming, essential for tasks such as data storage, configuration management, and logging. In Java, the java.io package provides classes for working with files and streams. This project aims to illustrate the basic concepts of file handling using simple examples.

File Handling Operations
1. Creating a File
The createFile method creates a new file if it does not already exist at the specified path. If the file already exists, it prints a message indicating its availability.

2. Writing to a File
The writeToFile method writes a predefined text to the file created earlier. It uses a FileWriter to write the content to the file.

3. Reading from a File
The readFromFile method reads the content of the file and prints it to the console. It uses a Scanner to read the file line by line and simulates a delay in reading with a sleep function, demonstrating a simple example of file reading with a time delay.
